#Player

This is a simple application that I'm using to teach how Backbone works

##Da rule

- Do not push your code to this repo ( you can make local branches !)

##How to make it work ?

Things you need 

- Computer (with internet)
- node.js
- npm
- ExpressJS

###Install node

     git clone https://github.com/joyent/node.git
     cd node
     ./configure
     make
     make install

###Install npm

npm comes with node now but if not

    brew install npm

###Install express

    npm install express -g

###Install dependencies

    npm install -d

###Run the application

    node app


Player should be running on localhost:3000
